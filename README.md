# Image Classification

I deployed a Convolutional Neural Network(ALL-CNN) for Object recognition. It obtains state of the art performance at object recognition on the CIFAR 10 image dataset in 2015. 

The CNN used was built using Kears(a high level Neural Network), application programming interface that supports theano and tensorflow backends. 

I used one-hot vector for categorical labels, added layers to the keras model, loaded pre-trained weights and made predicitions using this model. 

The dataset used was the CIFAR 10 which consists of 60,000 32 by 32 color images in 10 classes. 

## I  achieved an accuracy of 90.88%.

## The model was built using the research paper by Jost Tobias Sprigenberg titled Striving for Simplicity : The All Convolutioanal Net
